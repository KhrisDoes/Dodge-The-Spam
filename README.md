# Dodge The Spam

This is a very small and simple arcade game. The intention of this project  
is to make an Artificial Intelligence to play it and get the highest score  
possible. The difficulty of this game is that platforms drop at a higher speed
as the game progresses. To compensate, the player will start to move faster
(not yet implemented). This makes it almost impossible for a human player to control,
hence why the AI is introduced. I want to see how far it can go and how well it can learn to play.

# How to Play

Movement:  
Left arrow key - Move left   
Right arrow key - Move right  
Up arrow key Or Spacebar - Move up  
Reset: ESC (Escape) key
